This folder contains finite-state grammars, scripts, and lexical
material for compliling unweighted finite-state transducers (FSTs)
modeling Portuguese derivational morphology, using the free
software/open source finite-state packages Foma (Hulden 2009) and its
proprietary counterpart XFST (Beesley & Karttunen 2003), freely
available for non-commercial purposes. The focus is the formation of
diminutives, augmentatives, and superlatives (so called evaluative
suffixes, according to Villalva & Silvestre 2014, among others). The
lexical material contains word-lemma pairs in the space-text format,
which can be directly compiled into FSTs. These word-lemma pairs were
extracted from DELAF-PB and FreeLing and converted to spaced-text
using the Python module in the tools folder.  This implementation of
derivational morphology is work in progress. Beginning with the
diminutives, we will progressively include the other suffixes.  It is
assumed some familiarity with the paradigm of finite-state morphology
to understand the source files and eventually customize them to
exclude or include some derivations to suit a particular dialect of
Portuguese. For a birds-eye view on Foma basics, see, for example, the
first part of the following tutorial, which deals with unweighted
finite-state transducers:

Foma is concisely described in this paper:

Since Foma is practically a clone of XFST, they share the same
formalism (with minor exceptions) and virtually all commands. For an
in-depth understanding of finite-state morphology and XFST, see:

Beesley, K. R., Karttunen, L.: Finite State Morphology. CSLI, Stanford (2003).

To compile the FST with Foma and XFST, run the bash script

: BuildTestTransducers.sh

The FST is applied in both directions (i.e. generation and analysis)
to two test files.  To load the compiled FST binary in Foma and test
it interactively, run the following commands:

: foma -e "load suff02-foma.fst" 

and then in the Foma shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
foma[1]: up manguinhas
manga+N+DIM+F+PL
foma[1]: down elefante+N+DIM+M+SG
elefantezinho
elefantinho
foma[1]: 
#+END_SRC

The corresponding commands in XFST are the same, only the binary file
name is different:
: xfst -e "load suff02-xfst.fst"
