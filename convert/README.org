#+TITLE: translating between morphology dictionary formats

to translate classes from the Freeling/EAGLES format to MorphoBR's you
can either run the command from the Docker environment, or:
- install GF
- make sure you have the files from [[https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing/tree/master/data/pt/dictionary/entries][Freeling's Portuguese data]] in this
  directory
- run:
  : sh translate-all.sh
only nouns, simple verbs, adjectives, and adverbs work for now.
