* DELAF-PB
- 41 unique verb entries exhibit the following error, where a spurious
  colon precedes the comma separator:
  : mantinhas:,manter.V:I2s
- 135 verb entries exhibit the following error, where a spurious colon
  precedes the hyphen:
  : abstinhas:-lhe,abster.V+PRO:I2s
- removal of spurious and duplicate entries:
  : Gloria,Gloria.N:mp
  : Gloria,Gloria.N:ms
- filling of systematic gaps (missing tense forms):
  - the paradigms of the 1st verb conjugation systematically lacks the
    3rd person singular forms of two tenses: the imperfect indicative
    (all forms missing) and the plusperfect (all but 5 forms missing).
    These forms are identical to the corresponding ones of the 1st
    person. There seems to be no reason for these gaps, since the
    analog forms of the 2nd conjugation are present. These missing
    forms were included in MophoBr.
  - 2nd verb conjugation sistematically lacks SBJF 3 SG
  - enrichment of the annotation of verbs with clitic pronouns:
    DELAF-PB provides no lemma or morphosyntactic information for
    clitic pronouns in enclisis or mesoclisis:
    : compravam-nos,comprar.V+PRO:I3p
- 4 entries of imperative forms of verbs has uppercase =s=, indicating
  subjuntive instead of singular number:
  : sorri,sorrir.V:Y2S
- several hundred forms of infinitive had been marked as having two
  persons, where these should have been in two lines instead:
  : abstrair,abstrair.V:W31
- several hundred forms missing hifen:
  : protrairnos	protrair+V.None+SBJF+1+SG

- wrong tag in number: =C= instead of =N= (3 entries)
  : ônibus ônibus NCMC000
- entries without clitics still in the dictionary
  : ababadávamo ababadar+V+IMPF+1+PL
- ambiguous tag for degree: can be =C= or =D=
