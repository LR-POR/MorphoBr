Unless otherwise stated, the present resources are derived from the
dictionaries of the Unitex-PB project:

http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/nilc/projects/unitex-pb/web/dicionarios.html

The tagset used in the above project was converted to a more
mnemonical one which generally follows the notational conventions of
the descriptive linguistic and finite-state morphology literatures,
see tag_mapping.txt file.

In order to use MorphoBr resources for morphological analysis in XFST,
or in XLE in the context of syntactic parsing (e.g. with BrGram), they
must be compiled into finite-state transducers. Python modules as well
as XFST and bash scripts for performing this task will be made
available in the /tools folder. Inadequacies and errors found in the
Unitex-PB dictionaries were corrected using these tools. See the
respective incode documentation for a detailed description of the
changes made to the source entries.
