- Canonic repository :: https://github.com/LFG-PTBR/MorphoBr

- LICENSE :: see LICENSE file

Unless otherwise stated, the present resources are derived from the
dictionaries of the:

- Unitex-PB project :: http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/nilc/projects/unitex-pb/web/dicionarios.html

- Freeling Portuguese data :: https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing/tree/master/data/pt/dictionary/entries

     - which is itself derived from [[http://label.ist.utl.pt/pt/labellex_pt.php][LABEL-LEX]]
     - using unpublished data from /Garcia, Marcos et al./: available
       from commit [[https://github.com/LFG-PTBR/MorphoBr/tree/a0ebdbc496035642277788cecb156a169bae309b/tmp][a0ebdbc49603564227778]]

* Repository contents

Entries are separated by class, each in its own directory. Entries are
divided in small files, so that they can be previewed on GitHub and
processed in less powerful computers. The repository structure is
meant for development: if you would like a copy of the data, you
should go to our [[https://github.com/LFG-PTBR/MorphoBr/releases][releases page]].

Code (and its documentation) employed in the resource's development
can be found in the =tools/= directory.

* Tagset

The tagset used in the above projects was converted to a more
mnemonical one which generally follows the notational conventions of
the descriptive linguistic and finite-state morphology literatures,
see the =TAGSET= file.

* Morphological analysis

In order to use MorphoBr resources for morphological analysis in XFST,
or in XLE in the context of syntactic parsing (e.g. with BrGram), they
must be compiled into finite-state transducers. Python modules as well
as XFST and bash scripts for performing this task are available in the
=tools/= folder. Inadequacies and errors found in the source
dictionaries were corrected using these tools. See the respective
incode documentation for a detailed description of the changes made to
the source entries.
